description: Have you ever watched one of those "Animal Fail Compilation" videos on Youtube, where cats miss the ledge after leaping or horses run headfirst into a wired fence?  I always wondered what happened to these animals after the video cut. I therefore took a look at some animal rescue data from the London Fire Brigade. # the title that will show up once someone gets to this page

[The London Fire Brigade](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) attends a range of non-fire incidents (which we call 'special services'). These 'special services' include assistance to animals that may be trapped or in distress. The data is provided from January 2009 and is updated monthly. A range of information is supplied for each incident including some location information (postcode, borough, ward), as well as the data/time of the incidents. We do not routinely record data about animal deaths or injuries.

Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

```{r load_animal_rescue_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb/f43b485e-fb35-419c-aa7a-fa75676e5835/Animal%20Rescue%20incidents%20attended%20by%20LFB%20from%20Jan%202009.csv"


animal_rescue <- read_csv(url,
                          locale = locale(encoding = "CP1252")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()


glimpse(animal_rescue)
```

One of the more useful things one can do with any data set is quick counts, namely to see how many observations fall within one category. For instance, if we wanted to count the number of incidents by year, we would either use `group_by()... summarise()` or, simply [`count()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html)

```{r, instances_by_calendar_year}

animal_rescue %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(cal_year) %>% 
  summarise(count=n())

animal_rescue %>% 
  count(cal_year, name="count")

```

Let us try to see how many incidents we have by animal group. Again, we can do this either using group_by() and summarise(), or by using count()

```{r, animal_group_percentages}
animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  #group_by and summarise will produce a new column with the count in each animal group
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  
  # mutate adds a new column; here we calculate the percentage
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))


```

As for the first table, there is no observable increase in the amounts of rescues year to year. It can be argued that with an annually increasing population comes an increasing number of pets, which would lead to an upwards trend for the absolute number of rescues each year. This does not seem to be the case.

In regards to the distribution of rescued animals by type, it is not surprising that the most common kinds of animals kept as pets account for the most rescues. Specifically, the top three animals account for more than 80% of rescues on record. There also seem to be two separate groups for cats, both with and without capitalization. It could be the case that one refers to  small domestic cats, whereas the other includes all domesticated large cats (for example tigers). In this case, a separation might be reasonable if it is clearly depicted. If both refer to the same kind of cats, the two groups should be merged to make the distribution more accurate.

Finally, let us have a loot at the notional cost for rescuing each of these animals. As the LFB says,

> Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.

Before we go on, we need to fix `incident_notional_cost` as it is stored as a `chr`, or character, rather than a number.

```{r, parse_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

```

Now that incident_notional_cost is numeric, let us quickly calculate summary statistics for each animal group. 

```{r, stats_on_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

animal_rescue %>% 
  
  # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(mean_incident_cost))

```

Comparing the mean and median of each animal group, we can observe that all animal groups except for squirrel, ferret and rabbit have a higher mean than median. The gap is more significant for some animal groups than for others. What this tells us is that the distribution of these animal groups is left skewed. Therefore, most outliers lie to the right of the median, indicating that there are certain cases that cost significantly more than the average rescue for that group. Wile we cannot determine the cause for this increased expense, we can assume that some animals manage to bring themselves in such predicament that extreme measures are necessary (for example a horse stuck in a tree).

It is also curious to see that the minimum cost for all animal groups is about the same. The only exception to this is dogs, where the minimum cost is 0. As a dog person myself, I can relate to a rescuer willing to not charge for the rescue of a dog.

Generally, the data shows that the larger the animal, the more expensive the rescue. Nevertheless, we can see that the single most expensive rescue is attributed to a cat. It would be curious to investigate exactly why that cat proved to be so demanding. Not only do cats hold the record for the most expensive rescue, but also the most frequent peril. With 4152 rescues, they top the charts of incidents by a large margin. Again, this is most likely related to the fact that cats are popular and therefore frequently rescued pets.

Finally, let us plot a few plots that show the distribution of incident_cost for each animal group.

```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```

The boxplot best depicts the variability of the "incident_notional_cost" values. By looking at the width of the quartiles around the median, we can gauge how far the data points spread. It also gives a good view on the outliers of the each animal group.

In general, it can be said that the bigger the animal, the more expensive the rescue on average. This makes sense, as rescuing a horse with a considerable weight will probably require more manpower and machinery than pulling a cat from a tree. Nevertheless, as we can observe there are considerable outliers for most animal groups, in this case especially smaller animals. This could be explained by the fact that smaller animals are usually more agile and can therefore wedge themselves into potentially harder to reach areas. An example would be a cat getting stuck in an underground pipe, which would require the rescuers to dig up and open the pipe with heavy equipment.

It is also curious how many fox-related rescues there are in the dataset. A fox is usually not a domesticated animal, meaning that there would usually not be a person around to request a rescue. Perhaps foxes, as sly as they are, are especially good at getting themselves into a predicament and therefore the few domesticated foxes get rescued multiple times. Looking closer at the rescue location could provide some insights into this.

As for the differences in the patterns, we see a left skewed distribution for a large portion of the animal groups. For all those animal groups with a larger spread in the chart, there is usually few observations. Furthermore, by looking at the x-axis of these animal groups, we can see that the observations actually lie closely together. Given more incidents, we would most likely encounter more challenging rescues for these animal groups, leading to more outliers and therefore a left skewed distribution as well.
