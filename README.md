Welcome to the repository related to my portfolio website, which you can find under the link https://mychrispportfolio.netlify.app/.

The idea behind the website is to present myself and my work as I progress through the world of analytics and programming.

The website was created based on the Hugo Theme "Forty" and is hosted through netlify.

I will continue to update this repository as I build my portfolio. Stay tuned for future updates!
